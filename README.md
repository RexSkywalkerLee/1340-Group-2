the problem statement (i.e., what problem to solve), problem setting (e.g., reasonable assumptions)
Use digital tools to manage users' financial status. We target to build an accounting system to help people keep track of their income and expense. 

1) multiply users can manage their financial status through this accounting system;

2) each user can add,delete and edit any record at any time ;

3) each record contains information like amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game, salary, etc.), account (e.g cash, bank card, credit card, etc.); 


4) the accounting system allows monthly budget resetting and editing at any time. When expenses reach the budget, there will be an alert from the system;

5) the system can provide statistical report of usersâ€™ financial state : monthly, seasonly,yearly income and expenses, percentage of each type of income(salary, bonus etc.) and expenses(food, transportation etc.);

6) the system allows users to check their accounts information at any time, account information include credit card invoice, bank account balance, etc.; accounts information will be automatically updated each time the user add( or delete, edit) expense or income records;


7)  users could view their records by date, type, and account; 

8)  users could request a report of each day's profit(graphically) of latest 7 days
